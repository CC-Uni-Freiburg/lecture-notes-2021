Types int and bool

Strategy: keep values of types int and bool apart

For expression,

    exp1 + exp2

we require exp1 and expr2 to compute values of type int.
The return value also has type int.

We want to avoid confusing values of different types.

     1[42]

This doesn't in Python because we can't index an integer.
(unfortunately, Python is rather lenient wrt `int` and `bool`, so we
can write

      14 + True
      not 1

but this isn't allowed here...

The reason is that we don't want to confuse the different
interpretations of the 64-bit vectors that represent our values.

Second reason: we are going to use `bool` values for conditionals and
will take advantage of that in generating good code for them. (This is
partially due to particulars of the x64, in a RISC processor you could
get away without making a difference between `int` and `bool`.)

# type checking

formally we would say:

    exp1 : int
    exp2 : int
	--------------------
	exp1 + exp2 : int

    int-literal : int

    input_int() : int

    exp : int
    --------------------
	- exp : int

    exp : int
    ---------------
    print(exp) is stmt

For the Lvar, we need to manage assumptions about the type of
variables. The type is defined with the first assignment to the
variable.

    x = 42

This assignment indicate the type of `x` as `int` and subsequent
assignments to and uses of `x` must comply with that.

     print(x)

Ok. because of above rule.

     x = 4711

Ok. because type of `x` doesn't change.

     x = True

No (although ok in Python), because of our typing convention.

Extended formal statement:

     A |- exp : T

with assumptions `A` on the variables expression `exp` has type `T`

     x : T in A
     --------------------
     A |- x : T


     x not in A
     A |- exp : T
     ---------------------------
     A |- x = exp is stmt |- A, x : T

     x : T in A
     A |- exp : T
     ---------------------------
     A |- x = exp is stmt |- A, x : T

The typechecker would reject the configuration `x:bool in A` but `A |- exp : int`!

For Lif:

     A |- True : bool

     A |- False : bool

     A |- exp1 : bool
     A |- exp2 : bool
     ------------------------------
     A |- exp1 and exp2 : bool

similar for `or` and `not`.

     A |- exp1 : bool
     A |- exp2 : T
	 A |- exp3 : T
     ------------------------------
     A |- exp2 if exp1 else exp3 : T

all comparisons return `bool`

equality: lhs and rhs have same type

     A |- exp1 : T
	 A |- exp2 : T
     ------------------------------
     A |- exp1 == exp2 : bool

ordering: both operands are integers

     A |- exp1 : int
	 A |- exp2 : int
     ------------------------------
     A |- exp1 <= exp2 : bool
