# Compiler Construction Lab

## Task 2

Extend the framework from Task 1 with methods.

With this extension, it should be possible to write code like this.


```python
class RGB:
    red: int
	green: int
	blue: int
	
	def intensity (self) -> int:
        return self.red + self.green + self.blue

def test():
    r = RGB(100,24,0)
	print(r.intensity())
```

Proceed according to the following steps.
Be sure to create suitable tests during each step.

### Step 1

Extend the abstract syntax of classes by a field `methods` which contains method definitions.
The abstract syntax of expressions needs to be extended with method calls.

```python
@dataclass
class EMethod:
    e: Expr
	name: Id
    args: IList[Expr]


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SClass:
    name: Id
	fields: IList[tuple[Id, Type]]
	methods: IList[DFun]
```

* Integrate these definitions into `ast_1_python.py`.
* Extend the translation in `pass_0_1_parser.py` to map from Python's built-in `ast` representation to the new classes. Ignore the extra information in the `ast` objects for now.

### Step 2

Extend the type checker to handle class definitions with methods.
You have to extend the class for representing class types.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TClass:
    name: Id
	fields: IList[tuple[Id, Type]]
	methods: IList[tuple[Id, Type]]
```

* Extend the datastructure for types in `types_.py` accordingly.
* Extend `type_checker.py` to handle methods:
  * Names of methods in a class must be unique.
  * Every method must have at least one (first) argument named `self`.
  * Typechecking an expression of the form `EMethod(e, name, args)` requires obtaining the type of `e`, checking that it is a classtype, checking that the method `name` exists, checking that the types of the arguments with the method type, and returning the return type of the method (if the former steps were successful).
  * As a side effect, store the (class) type of `e` as an additional field `type` in the `EMethod` object.


### Step 3

Extend the interpreter to handle class definitions with methods.
A suitable representation for class objects looks like this (the representation of objects remains the same):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class VClass:
    name: Id
	methods: IList[tuple[Id, Value]]
```


* Change this class in `semantics.py`.
* Extend the interpreter to handle method calls. Remember that the first parameter `self` of a method has to be set to the object receiving the method call. 


### Step 4

Extend the compiler. Much of this can be done in the shrinking pass.

* You have to revise the construction the class object: The method definitions have to be processed like function definitions. The resulting closure objects have to be stored in the respective slot of the class object.
* Translate instances of `EMethod(e, name, args)` as follows
  * Obtain the class type of `e` from `e.type`
  * Find the position `i` of `name` in `e.type.methods`
  * Replace by `clazz = ETupleAccess(e, 0)`  and `mimpl = ETupleAccess (clazz, i)`.
  * Invoke the closure in `mimpl` on `e` (the receiver object of the method call) and the arguments `args`.
