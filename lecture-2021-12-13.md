# notes on the interpreter

In Fig 7.2 we have

	Module( [def ... stmt... ]

but the interpreter really just consider the function definitions in the module.
Before invoking interpreter the statement list is transformed into a single toplevel function definition:

	FunctionDef ('main', [], stmt..., None, int, None)

Afterwards we have a module consisting of definitions only!
(This transformation is apparently done by the implementation of the type checker.)

#  notes about the type checker (fig 7.5)

(what about `self.check_type_equal`? No, `check_type_equal` is correct; it's defined in `interp_Pvar.py`)

Question: what happens if the body of a function contains multiple `return` statements, for example, in the branches of a conditional?
(I think it's a problem, will check the code!)
Ok, the conditional statement is handled as follows:

      case If(test, body, orelse):
        test_t = self.type_check_exp(test, env)
        check_type_equal(bool, test_t, test)
        body_t = self.type_check_stmts(body, env)
        orelse_t = self.type_check_stmts(orelse, env)
        check_type_equal(body_t, orelse_t, ss[0])
        return self.type_check_stmts(ss[1:], env)

that is, if there is a `return` in the `True` branch, it sets `body_t` to the return type. If there is `return` in the `False` branch, it sets `orelse_t` to the return type. Then it checks them to be equal, if so it returns the type.

If there are statement following a `return` statement, then they are ignored.

Question:

	def f() -> int:
		return 42
	def g() -> int:
		return 44
	
`type_check` invokes `type_check_stmts`on `[FunDef(f), FunDef(g)]`.
For each function definition, there is a recursive call of `type_check_stmts` on the body of that function.

# notes about the interpreter

Important: In `interp`, we create an environment that contains the functions and each function entry contains a pointer to the same environment!
This is important to enable recursive and mutually recursive functions.

# notes about 7.2 x86

lea = load effective address

Need indirect function call to handle function pointers like the `inc` in the example invocation `map( inc, (41, 1) )` in fig 7.3.

More precisely, in this expression, we need `leaq` to obtain the address of `inc` and in the body of `map` we need `callq *` to indirectly invoke `inc` via that address.

(There is an official Intel calling convention for the x86-64 architecture, which is used by languages like C. THAT convention stores parameters 7, 8, ... onwards on the stack in the caller's frame.)

**We don't do that here!**

Instead, we pass argument in registers and if there are more than six, we pack the extra arguments into a tuple. To simplify handling of the stack in our compiler.

# tail calls

Each active function call corresponds to a frame on the stack.
Therefore, we use stack space according to the maximum number of active function calls (at the same). In particular, with recursive functions (or mutually recursive functions).
This is annoying because it limits the use of recursion.
A real, hard limit in Python!
In most functional languages, we must use recursion because there is no other looping construct.

# comments on Fig 7.6

Two things are omitted in the figure...

1. optional padding of the frame to make its size a multiple of 16
2. caller-saved registers

... maybe intended to be included in the local variables.

What about additional function arguments?
In our setting: no.  
(With the Intel-calling convention: yes:

    optional padding (dependent on the number of actual parameters...)
	last param n
    param n-1
	...
	param 7

    return address
	saved rbp
	...

Fortunately, we can ignore that.)
