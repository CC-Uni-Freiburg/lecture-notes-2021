# why IfExp(exp1, exp2, exp3) and Let(var, exp1, exp2)?

instead of `IfExp(atm1, atm2, atm3)`...

## exp1 vs atm1

* it would be correct to use atm1, but
* we can generate better code if we have the expression for the condition
* the RCO transformation (and the type checker) guarantees that exp1
  has a form like `atm11 == atm12`, etc, that we can easily map to
  an instruction

## exp2 vs atm2

* that's a correctness issue
* suppose we transform this expression

      if i< len(s) then s[i] else 0

to atoms in the branches:

     tmp0 = len(s)
     tmp1 = s[i]
     if i < tmp0 then tmp1 else 0

That changes the semantics: if not(i < len(s)), then this code
executes s[i], anyway, which leads to an exception.

* therefore use the Let expression:

      if cond then 3 * x + 1 else x // 2

but the then-branch is not an exp in L_if^mon language.
To amend that, we use the Let expression like this:

      if cond then Let(tmp1, 3 *x, tmp1 + 1) else x // 2

on the top-level:

      a = 3 * x + 1

gets transformed to

	tmp = 3 * x
	a = tmp + 1

# basic blocks

In C_If code is structured as a dictionary that maps labels sequences
of statements. But these sequences are not arbitrary:
they start with
* assignments
* prints
* expressions
and that end with a control transfer:
* return
* jump
* conditional jump

Such sequences are called *basic blocks*.

Notice: it's not possible to jump into the middle of such a
sequence. Because you only have a label for the beginning of the sequence.

# expressions with side effects

	print(input_int() if input_int() == 1 else 42)

....   a / b 

# liveness in the presence of conditionals

         live_in = {y, x}
    if x<y then 
         live_in = live_in(block1) U live_in(block2) = {y, x}
    goto block1 else goto block2;

    block1:
     	live_in = {x}
	b = x * 2
     	live_in = {b,x}
    a = b+1
     	live_in = {a,x}
    jump block3 <---

    block2:
        live_in = {y, x}
    a = y
	    live_in = {a,x}
	jump block3  <---

    block3:     live_in = {a, x}  --> propagate to all predecessors
    return a+x
