# continuing presentation of garbage collection slides

Example:

    T = ( ( 42,) ,)
    print( T[0][0] )


This is Fig 6.10 from the book, which shows its intermediate represenation after `expose_allocation`:

	print( T1[0][0] )

	where T1 is

	begin:
		tmp.1 = T2
		if global_value(free_ptr) + 16 < global_value(fromspace_end): 0
		else:
            collect(16)
		tmp.2 = allocate(1, TupleType(TupleType([int])))
        tmp.2[0] = tmp.1
		tmp.2

	and T2 is

    begin:
	         tmp.3 = 42
             if global_value(free_ptr) + 16 < global_value(fromspace_end): 0
	   	     else: collect(16)
	         tmp.4 = allocate(1, TupleType([int]))
             tmp.4[0] = tmp.3
             tmp.4

It treats the allocation of the two nested tuples entirely separate.
As an optimization, we consider combining the two allocations in one!
Why?

* we are compiling a piece of straightline code, so all allocation will happen anyway!
* we can elide one of the tests against free_ptr by allocating memory for both tuples at once.


    if global_value(free_ptr) + 32 < global_value(fromspace_end): 0
    else: collect(32)

    tmp.1 = allocate (1, TupleType ([int]))
    tmp.1[0] = 42
    tmp.2 = allocate (1, TupleType (TupleType ([int])))
	tmp.2[0] = tmp.1
	tmp.2

If we select instructions according to the book, then we still access the `free_ptr` two times.
But we could elide that and increment the `free_ptr` just once for both allocations.
