# assigned reading: Chapter 10


Q: what if we do `x + y` where `x` is known to be `int` and `y: Any`?

The gradual type checker accepts because
1. for both arugments it expects type `int`
2. for the left arg: `int ~ int` (where `~` means consistent)
3. for the right arg: `int ~ Any`

Then it's up to the interpreter/compiler to generate the checks that
ensure that `y` can be projected to `int`.

# Figure 10.3

`map` is fully typed, `inc: Any -> Any`

Calling `map` requires (in the first argument):
`int -> int` `~` `Any -> Any`
The types are consistent:
* both are functions
* their argument and return types are consistent

This example is expected to run without problem!

# type checking for function definitions

In `type_check_stmt` we have to check the return type of the method
body against the declared return type:

	case FunctionDef(var, prms, stmts, None, ret_type, None):
		p_vars, p_types = unzip(prms)
		new_env = env.copy(). extend(prms)
		body_t = self.type_check_stmts(stmts)
		self.check_consistent(ret_type, body_t, stmts)

In a conditional, the `join_types` operation tries to deliver a type
as precise as possible. It follows the most specific information
available.

The implementation of `join_types` assumes that the input types are
consistent! For that reason, the `case (_, _)` can only be reached in
the case where `t1 == t2` by definition of consistency.

# Figure 10.7

In the case for `Call(func, args)`, there are some problemsp:
* purpose of `unzip` unclear (suggest delete)
* need to check the `len(args_t) == len(params_t)` !!

# Figure 10.8

should be needed for typed assignments, but that part is missing?!


# Figure 10.9

* `env[id] = t` should be `env[id] = value_ty`

# Figure 10.11

the `list[...]` specifies a *mutable* array type of fixed size (given by
the array creation). At run time: `new array(3)` or the literal
`[1,2,3]` to create an array
of size 3. Unlike the tuple type, the elements can be assigned to.

`v = [0, 41]` creates a `list[int]` of size 2. Now `v:list[int]`.

After calling `map_inplace` we expect `v` still to have the same type,
which means that `v[1]:int` such that this value can be printed!

Looking at the call of `map_inplace`:
* first arg: `int -> int` function expected and `inc` fits this type.
* second arg: `list[Any]` expected, but get `list[int]`

Extend definition of consistency in the obvious way so that `list[Any]
~ list[int]`. Look at `f(v[i])` in the body of `map_inplace`.

Here, `v:list[Any]` so `v[i]: Any`. To apply `f`, project to
`int`. The result has type `f(v[i]): int`. It must be assigned to
`v[i]:Any`, so we need to inject it again into `Any`.

But we expect that this assignment affects the *underlying* array of
type `list[int]`. One suggestion: on calling the function make a copy
of the argument, where we replace all `int`s with their corresponding
injected values. (That would be fine for a tuple because we cannot
write to a tuple.)

For the `list` type, this suggestion does not work! Any assignment
would work on the local copy, but we want it to work on the original
structure!

Solution will be to add a specific proxy object, but first let's go
for the simpler cases.

# Figure 10.13

In the case for
 `case (FunctionType(ps1, rt1), FunctionType(ps2, rt2))`

we know that `value` is a function. Now we want to perform casts on
its arguments according to `ps1` and `ps2` and a cast on the result
according to `rt1` and `rt2`.

The idea is to define a wrapper function that contain these casts as
follows (if `len(ps1) == len(ps2) == n`):

	lambda x1, ..., xn: 
		Cast(value(Cast(x1, ps2_1, ps1_1), ..., Cast(xn, ps2_n, ps1_n)), rt1, rt2)

Why is that correct?

Consider the concrete example of the `inc` function.
We have `inc: Any -> Any` and let's say we want to cast it to `int ->
int` (as need to do when passing it to `map`.

	map( Cast(inc, Any -> Any, int -> int), ...)

Inside of `map` we apply this function to an `int`, say `42`.

So we look at this:

	Cast(inc, Any->Any, int->int) ( 42 )

Apply the above transformation:

	(lambda x1: Cast(inc(Cast(x1, int, Any), Any, int)) (42)

	(lambda x1: project(inc(inject(x1, int), int))) (42)

--> (some evaluation steps)

	project(inc(inject(42, int), int))

-->

    project(inject(43, int), int)

-->

	43

we are going to discuss the evaluation and the remaining  important
parts of chapter 10.
