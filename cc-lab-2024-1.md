# Compiler Construction Lab

## Task 1

Extend the final compiler template from the lecture with *data classes*.

We want to support writing code like this.

```python
class RGB:
    red: int
	green: int
	blue: int

def intensity (v: RGB) -> int:
    return v.red + v.green + v.blue

def test():
    r = RGB(100,24,0)
	print(intensity(r))
```

Proceed according to the following steps.
Be sure to create suitable tests during each step.

### Step 1

Extend the abstract syntax with one expression class (for field access) and one statement class (for class definitions).

```python
@dataclass
class EField:
    e: Expr
	name: Id

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SClass:
    name: Id
	fields: IList[tuple[Id, Type]]
```

* Integrate these definitions into `ast_1_python.py`.
* Extend the translation in `pass_0_1_parser.py` to map from Python's built-in `ast` representation to the new classes. Ignore the extra information in the `ast` objects for now.

### Step 2

Extend the type checker to handle class definitions and field accesses.
A new class for representing class types is required.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TClass:
    name: Id
	fields: IList[tuple[Id, Type]]
```

* Extend the datastructure for types in `types.py` accordingly.
* Extend `type_checker.py` to handle class types:
  * The class definition gives rise to a function binding for the constructor in the context.
  * Names of classes and functions must be unique.
  * Typechecking an expression of the form `EField(e, name)` requires obtaining the type of `e`, checking that it is a classtype, checking that the field `name` exists, and returning the type of the field (if the former steps were successful).
  * As a side effect, store the (class) type of `e` as an additional field `type` in the `EField` object.

### Step 3

Extend the interpreter to handle class definitions and field accesses.
A suitable representation for objects looks like this:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class VClass:
    name: Id

@dataclass
class VObject:
    classref: VClass
	fields: dict[Id, Value]
```

The separation between the class object `VClass` and the instance object `VObject` is deliberate,
as the class object will be extended in subsequent tasks and this structure matches the compiled code.
It corresponds to the object that Python returns when invoking the `type` function on an object.

* Define the above classes in `semantics.py`.
* Extend the interpreter to handle constructor calls and field accesses.

### Step 4

Extend the compiler. Much of this can be done in the shrinking pass.

* The definition should create an empty tuple that serves as the class object.
* Generate the constructor function. If the class has `n` fields, then the function takes `n` parameters, creates a tuple of length `n+1` and fills the tuple by storing the class object at position `0`, followed by the parameter values in sequence.
* Translate instances of `EField(e, name)` as follows
  * Obtain the class type of `e` from `e.type`
  * Find the position `i` of `name` in `e.type.fields`
  * Replace by `ETupleAccess(e, i+1)`  (the `+1` skips over the class object at position `0` in the tuple).
