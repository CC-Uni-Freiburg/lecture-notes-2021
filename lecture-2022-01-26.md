# today's topic: parsing

The lecture is summarized here (preliminary):
[material/lexical-analysis.pdf](material/syntax-analysis.pdf)

The accompanying Python code may be found here:

# translation of def 2.1 to Python

Sequences over `M` are like `list[M]`

* $\varepsilon$ == `[]` empty sequence
* $|w|$ == `len(w)`
* $w^k$ == `w * k`
* $w_{|k}$ == `w[:k]`  $k$-prefix of a sequence

# remark about def 2.5

In Python terms, the type of the parser is

	def parser_L(inp: list[TS]) -> Iterator[list[TS]]:
	    pass

# intuition of elimination of left recursion

look at the productions for A.
Everything derivable from A has the form:

	A => a_i
	A => A b_x => A b_y b_x
                      => a_j b_x

In general

	A =>* a_i b_x b_y b_z ...

In the transformed grammar:

	A => a_i A'
       => a_i
       => a_i b_x A' => a_i b_x b_y A' => a_i b_x b_y

* next topic: deterministic recursive descent parsing, computation of
  first and follow sets for the lookahead
