From 3-address code / pseudo assembly (after register allocation) to real assembly code:

| 3-address | R-V assembly | R-V assembly
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| mv r, $0   |  li r, 0   |  add  r, x0, x0 |
| mv r, $16 |  li r, 16 | addi r, x0, 16 |

* `r` stands for a RISC-V register name (i.e., temporaries have been mapped to registers, already)
* `li r, n` is an assmbler macro that gets expanded to different instructions depending on the size of `n`.

## stack frame layout

stack space of the caller before call

        +-----
        |
	    |  local variables of caller
		|  caller-saved registers
	    |  arguments to callee
    sp  +------------------
	
when call happens

        +-----
        |
	    |  local variables of caller
	    |  arguments to callee
    fp  +------------------
    	| return address
		| frame pointer of caller
		|    callee-saved registers
        |  stack space of callee
    sp  +------------------


## calculation of the interference graph

We consider instruction _Ik_ with _Lk_ standing for the set of temporaries live after _Ik_

* regular instructions: _Ik = op d, s1, s2_
  * _d_ is written, _s1_ and _s2_ are read
  * _d_ interferes with all _r_ in _Lk_, but not with _d_ itself
* move instruction: _lk = mv d, s_
  * _d_ is written, _s_ is read
  * _d_ interferes with all _r_ in _Lk_, but neither with _d_ nor with _s_
  * rationale: consider the outcome of subsequent graph coloring
	* if _d_ and _s_ are assigned different colors, then there is no issue.
    * if _d_ and _s_ are assigned the same color, then the move becomes trivial, _d_ and _s_ contain the same value so that they become exchangeable in the rest of the basic block.
	
## including the implicit temporary in register allocation

* our suggestions for code generation use `a0` as a scratch register
* can we instead assign a scratch register during register allocation?
* not really:
  * we can eliminate some immedate arguments: `add d, $42, s` --> `mv tmp, $42; add, d, tmp, s` (though we'd prefer to use the `addi` instruction in this case)
  * mostly, we use the scratch register to eliminate memory operands like `-24(fp)`. But memory operands are eliminates _after_ register allocation, so it wouldn't work to introduce fresh temporaries at that point.
