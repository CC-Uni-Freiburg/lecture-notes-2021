# x is live, although not on any execution path

if false:
   x = x + 1
else:
   pass
   
As another example: for the liveness analysis, a is live here

```
if cond(x,y):
	...
	if cond(x,y):
	    ...
	else:
	    use[a]
```

# work list algorithm for calculating a fixed point

initialization:

for each n:
	IN[n] = 0
	OUT[n] = 0
	
put all nodes of the CFG into a data structure, the *work list*
for example, put the exit node last into the work list
(it would be enough to start with work list := { exit })

while work list not empty:
	*choose* node n from work list (intelligently, i.e., go backwards in CFG)
	(and remove n)
	calculate OUT[n] and IN[n]
	if IN[n] changes:
    	put all m \in pred[n] on top of the work list
