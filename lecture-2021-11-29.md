title: Chapter 6 Tuples and Garbage Collection

# assigned reading for today: until 6.2

one of the main topics: memory management
because we add tuples to the language -> doesn't fit into a single
64-bit word
the number and size of tuples needed in a program is not a-priori
known -> need to dynamically allocate memory for each tuple!
In C: you'd have to use malloc(). If a block of memory is no longer
used, then need to manually return that block by calling free().

In Python, tuples conceptually live forever, but if our program cannot
reach a tuple anymore, Python is *reclaiming* the memory space for other objects.

# some terminology


* heap: region in memory reserved for dynamic allocation of data at
  run-time of a program. Grows with every allocation, shrinks with
  every region return to the memory manager. Can be managed manually
  (malloc/free approach) or automatically:

* reclaim: return a memory region to the operating system or the
  memory allocator (some library that manages dynamic memory). Assumes
  that your program doesn't have acces to that region anymore!

* garbage collection: program is only responsible for allocating
  memory, returning memory regions to the memory manager is done
  automatically, by the *garbage collector* (GC). When GC detects that
  some region is no longer reachable from the program, then it frees
  (reclaims) that region automatically and thus enables its reuse.

* mutator / collector : the actual program is called *mutator*,
  because the program is the one that changes the state of the heap.

* root pointers: the mutator has to communicate to the collector,
  which (all) memory locations contain pointers to heap-allocated
  data. The *root pointers* are those pointers from which all
  dynamically allocated data is reachable. Root pointers may be stored
  in
  * processor registers
  * global variables
  * local variables (on the run-time stack)
  Attention: on the stack there is a mixture of pointers, other data
  (!), return addresses (!) - the later two should not be changed by
  the GC!

* generational collectors: a generalization of the two-space collector
  (explained in the book), there are more than two spaces, and the
  management of the spaces is different (more next lecture).
  
* mark and sweep: the other traditional GC method with different
  trade-offs. Idea: traverse (depth-first) the structures reachable
  from the root pointers and mark everything reachable. Afterwards,
  everything that's unmarked can be attached to a (so called) free
  list, a list of (pointers to and sizes) of free memory blocks.
  The free list organization is often used with malloc as well: malloc
  just picks a suitable block from the free list. (more next lecture)

* shallow copy: (pointer data structures like tuples) to copy a tuple,
  you just copy the pointer, not the content of the tuple. Thus,
  tuples can be shared by assignment. (In Python this is not really
  observable, unless you use the "is" operator.)

* aliases: more than one pointer to the same data
  structure. Potentially dangerous in the presence of mutable data
  structures. For Python tuples, aliasing is harmless as they are
  immutable.
