# consider the dataflow equations for liveness

    FB : Lbefore[n] = R[n] U Lafter[n] \ W[n]
    FA : Lafter[n]    = U { Lbefore[m] | m is successor of n }

The function FB that computes Lbefore from Lafter is *monotone*:
If A ⊆ A' then FB(A) ⊆ FB(A')
The function FA that computes Lafter from Lbefore is *monotone*:
If B ⊆ B' then FA(B) ⊆ FA(B')

That means, with each iteration the Lbefore and Lafter sets get
bigger.
Initially, A0 = ∅ and B0 = ∅  (all nodes have empty liveness information)
Clearly, A1 = FA(B0) ⊇ ∅ and B1 = FB(A0) ⊇ ∅.
Now, FA(B1) ⊇ FA(B0) because B1 ⊇ B0 and FA is monotone.
Likewise, FB(A1) ⊇ FB(A0) because A1 ⊇ A0 and FB is monotone.
And so on: A0 ⊆ A1 ⊆ A2 ⊆ ...
as well as: B0 ⊆ B1 ⊆ B2 ⊆ ...

Second observation: these sequences must become stationary because
each Ai and Bi is subset of the set of variables in the program
(finite) union the set of registers (finite).

Hence, there must be some i such that A[i] = A[i+1] and B[i] = B[i+1].

That means, the iteration terminates.
Moreover, it calculates the least fixed point of the functions FA, FB.
Since it is the least fixed point, it does not contain superfluous
elements. 

# dataflow analysis on the level of basic blocks

Inside of a basic block, the propagation of liveness information is
just like in Chapter 3 for straightline code.
Therefore, we only apply the fixed point iteration on the level of
basic blocks. As the number of basic blocks is much lower than the
number of statements, iteration on (the flow graph of) basic blocks is
much more efficient.

(In principle, we would have to prove that the calculation on the
basic block level yields the same results as on the statement
level. Others have done it.)
(on a similar note, the worklist algorithm works subtly different than
the "whole-step" algorithm that we discussed. Others have proved that
both algorithms compute the same results.)
