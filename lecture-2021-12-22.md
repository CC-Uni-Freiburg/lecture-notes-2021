# note on 8.5 closure conversion

The translation of `FunctionType` is only about the interface.
It does not describe the types of the free variables that may be part
of the underlying closure.
In the resulting closure type, we therefore only describe the first
component of the tuple (and ignore the remaining components that
contain free variables).
The first component contains the function, which is modified to take a
closure (modeled by `TupleType([])`) followed by the orginal parameters.
We don't write a precise type for the closure because it is the data
object that we are currently describing! Its proper description would
be recursive, but we punt on that (for simplicity).

# note on example in Fig 8.8

The definition of f after translation.
The return type is computed according to the translation of
`FunctionType`, so it just describes the interface. In particular,
it claims to return a one-tuple with the code pointer.
However, its body returns a three-tuple, where the first component is
the code pointer and the 2nd and 3rd components contain values of free
variables.
Ordinarily, this would be a type error because the number of tuple
components does not match!
But the type checker for this intermediate language ignores this
mismatch to enable *casting* a closure to its interface (function)
type.
Also, the real type of `lambda_0` doesn't match the declared return
type of `f`: instead of spelling out the component types of the
closure, we just state it's a tuple of type `tuple[]`.
Also accepted by the type checker for this intermediate language.

# note on types vs garbage collection

We've taken some liberties with the types of tuples in this
translation... We might worry whether the heap records are correctly
tagged as pointer/non-pointer values for the garbage
collector. Fortunately, this detail is only needed when we create the
closure, at which time enough type information is available to set the
tag bits correctly!

# note on let vs begin

Let can be replaced by begin, which is more general and must be used
for initializing tuples.

	let x1=e1 in let x2=e2 in ... in body
	==>
	begin: x1=e1; x2=e2; ...; body

# fig 9.3 comparison

Case `Compare` implements polymorphic equality, which means it works
for any combination of argument types!

# fig 9.5 apply_fun

Before the type checker made sure that functions are called with the
correct number of parameter: not anymore! Instead, we get a runtime
error if the number of provided arguments does not match the formal
parameters.

... but beware: the Python version of chapter 9 is currently
unfinished, but ETA is in week 1/22 (around January 3). Will be posted
in the forum.
