# assigned reading: chapter 9

We start with a dynamically typed program.
Here we the invariant: every expression returns value of type Any.
Therefore:

*  no static type checker necessary
*  at run time (cf interpreter) untag before each operation to reveal
the actual type and tag again after operation.

Next, transition to LAny. This language makes the tagging and
untagging explicit, which means we have a typed language, again!

Why? Consider this example:

	e = e1 + e2

in the dynamically typed interpreter:

	tag( untag(interp(e1), int) + untag(interp(e2), int), int) : Any

where interp(e1) : Any, interp(e2) : Any

Now translate e into LAny:

	e' = Inject( Project( e1', int)  + Project (e2', int), int)

given:      e1' : Any
we get:    Project (e1', int) : int
given:      e2' : Any
we get:    Project (e2', int) : int

now:        Project (e1', int) + Project (e2', int) : int
and:         Inject( Project (e1', int) + Project (e2', int), int) :
Any


We make the tagging explicit in this way so that we can later optimize
it. For instance:

	1 + 2

gets translated into the LAny expression

	Inject(1, int) : Any
	Inject(2, int) : Any

	Inject( Project (Inject (1, int), int) + Project (Inject (2, int), int), int)

Obviously: Project (Inject (x, T), T) = x

So the above optimizes to

	Inject( 1 + 2, int)

or maybe even to

	Inject (3, int)

# error at end of 9.5

The translation of

	Call(Name('any_tuple_load'), [e1,e2])

should be

	Begin([Assign([t], e′1), Assign([i], e′2)],
	IfExp(Compare(TagOf(t), [Eq()], [Constant(2)]),
      IfExp (Compare (TagOf(i), [Eq()], [Constant(1)])
        IfExp(Compare(ValueOf(i), [Lt()], [Call(Name('any_len'), [t])]),
	      Call(Name('any_tuple_load'), [t, ValueOf(i)]),
                Call(Name('exit'), [])),
              Call(Name('exit'), [])),
           Call(Name('exit'), [])))

(it's weird that `any_tuple_load` is also used on the rhs of the translation. Let's see how this is
handled.
My expectation at that point would have been:

	TupleLoad(ValueOf(t), ValueOf(i))

i.e. completely unsafe code, but protected by the code that we just generated)

In section 9.10 we learn:

	any_len : (Any) -> Int
	any_tuple_load : (Any, Int) -> Any

where the first argument is expected to be a tagged tuple value.

# comment on 9.10, make_any

You select the two alternative instruction sequences for `make_any` by looking at the *tag* value...

# assigned reading: none!

next week we're going to look at
* bootstrapping (aka writing the compiler from scratch)
* frontend stuff (lexing and parsing)
