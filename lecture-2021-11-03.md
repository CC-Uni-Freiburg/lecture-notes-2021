* Reading for this session: chapter 3

* example program

```python
v = 1
w = 42
x = v + 7
y = x
z = x + w
print(z + (- y))
```

* corresponding x86 program

```
movq $1, v
movq $42, w
movq v, x
addq $7, x
movq x, y
movq x, z
addq w, z
movq y, tmp_0
negq tmp_0
movq z, tmp_1
addq tmp_0, tmp_1
movq tmp_1, %rdi
callq print_int
```

# calling conventions

# caller-saved vs callee-saved

consider function A calls function B.
A is caller
B is callee

* caller-saves register r11:

assume A is using r11 (A can use r11 freely, it doesn't have to be restored on return from A)
now A invokes function B
since r11 is caller-saves, B can use r11 without restriction
the function call to B may destroy the value that A stored in r11
if A want to preserve that value, it must take measures to save the value and restore it after return from B

* callee-saves register r12:

if A wants to use r12, it must must save its value on entry to A and restore before returning.
when A invokes B, then A can assume that r12 is preserved.




* example with function calls

```python
x = input_int()
y = input_int()
print((x + y) + 42)
```

* corresponding x86 program

this program saves a register in the stack frame

```
	.globl main
main:
	pushq %rbp
	movq %rsp, %rbp
	pushq %rbx     ; rbx is callee-saves, we use rbx => must save it to the stack frame
	subq $8, %rsp  ; padding the stack pointer to multiple of 16
	; end of prologue
	callq read_int   ; no parameters
	movq %rax, %rbx  ; pick up return value => rbx
	                           ; why did we choose rbx?
                               ; because rbx is preserved across the function call (it's callee-saves)
	callq read_int
	movq %rax, %rcx ; pick up return value => rcx, which is caller-saves
	movq %rbx, %rdx
	addq %rcx, %rdx
	movq %rdx, %rcx
	addq $42, %rcx
	movq %rcx, %rdi
	callq print_int
	; epilogue
	addq $8, %rsp
	popq %rbx
	popq %rbp
	retq
```

Alternative that does not use a callee-saves register

```
	.globl main
main:
	pushq %rbp
	movq %rsp, %rbp
	; end of prologue
	callq read_int   ; no parameters
	movq %rax, %r11  ; pick up return value => r11
	                           ; but r11 is caller-saves, so the next line (function call) may clobber it!
                               ; so we (caller) must save it before calling!
    pushq %r11          ; save r11
    subq $8,rsp         ; align sp
	callq read_int
	addq $8,rsp         ; ...
    popq %r11           ; restore caller-saves register
	movq %rax, %rcx ; pick up return value => rcx, which is caller-saves
	movq %r11, %rdx
	addq %rcx, %rdx
	movq %rdx, %rcx
	addq $42, %rcx
	movq %rcx, %rdi
	callq print_int
	; epilogue
	popq %rbp
	retq
```






## liveness

* discussed the general case from this slide set (https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/compilerbau/2016ws/10-liveness.pdf)

* difference between execution path and path in CFG

Consider the CFG of this program fragment:

```
if x > 0:
    a = 5
    if x < 0:
        b = 10
```

in the CFG, there is a path (x > 0), (a=5), (x<0), (b=10).
But there is no such execution path! because x>0 and x<0 are contradictory.

This results in an approximation of liveness. The approximation makes it computable.


```
movq $5, a
movq $30, b
movq a, c
movq $10, b
addq b, c
```
