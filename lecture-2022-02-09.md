case in question

	g = Cast( maybe_inc, Any -> Any, Int -> Int ) : Int -> Int

on the return type:

	Cast ( return_value, Any, Int )

on the argument type (notice the reversed direction):

	Cast ( arg, Int, Any )

You invoke `g` with an Int!
Cast the argument to Any!
Invoke `maybe_inc` (takes an Any and return Any)
Cast return value to int!

So `g` behaves like an int->int function!


The handling of `tuple`in 10.13 is more general than necessary.
Alternatively, we could do this:

Consider the cast

	Cast( t, tuple[int, bool], tuple[Any, Any] )

Input is `t`
Output should be an any,any-tuple.
Since the tuple type is immutable, we can create a copy of the tuple
that contains the original values cast to Any.

result of the cast should be

	t_casted = [ Cast(t[0], int, Any), Cast(t[1], int, Any) ]

Ok, because of immutability, `t_casted` will not change and neither
does `t`.

(The case for `list` is more complicated because `list` is mutable
and we want updates on the casted value to be reflected on the
orginal value. This is achieved by inserting a proxy object that
progates updates between the original list object and the casted
object. This propagation has to involve the cast operations. )

## still one cast to discuss ...

looked at
* casts for simple types (int, bool, ...)
* casts between function and tuple types

missing thing: casts between function and any.
There are two cases:

* the simple case, where we cast from `Any` to
  `FunctionType([Any,...], Any)` --- it corresponds to projection
* the general case
  `Any` to `FunctionType([t1, ..., tn], tr) i.e. where the argument
  and return types are not all `Any` types

The latter case we factorize the cast into a projection followed by a
function cast!

Example:

	Cast( f, Any, Int -> Int )

-->

	Cast( Cast( f, Any, Any->Any), Any->Any, Int->Int)

We can deal with both components.

Analogously for tuples.

Analogously for the other direction:

To cast `FunctionType([t1,..,tn], tr)` to `Any` we factorize into a
function cast and an injection.

Example:

	Cast( f, Bool->Bool, Any )

-->

	Cast( Cast( f, Bool->Bool, Any->Any ), Any->Any,  Any )

Again, we can deal with both components.

the types that are targets for projections are called *ground types*
(or *flat types*). These are

* the primitive types (int, bool, ...)
* FunctionType([Any, ...], Any)
* TupleType([Any, ...])
* etc for other type constructions

Remark: the code in 10.13 is a bit too conservative.
Consider the case
that `src = Any` and `tgt = FunctionType([Any], Any])`
In this case, `anyfun == tgt` and the outer cast could be elided.
An optimized implementation would do that (and certainly a serious
compiler woud do it).
